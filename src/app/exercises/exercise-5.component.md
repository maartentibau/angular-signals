# Angular Signal: Intersection Observer

## Background

The Intersection Observer API is a browser feature that efficiently detects visibility changes without relying on scroll event listeners. It is commonly used for lazy loading images, triggering animations, or fetching additional data when an element enters the viewport.

By implementing this function, you'll be able to easily track the visibility of elements in Angular components, enhancing the user experience and optimizing performance.
## Exercise

This exercise involves creating a reusable Angular function that utilizes the Intersection Observer API to observe a given element's visibility in the viewport. The function will emit a signal indicating whether or not the observed element is currently visible.
